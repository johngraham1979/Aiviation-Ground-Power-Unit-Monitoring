There is increasing solid state and otherwise computerized technology in 3-phase ground power units for powering large machine such as aircraft. 

Due to old standards and expectations, some devices however may have to continue with mpodbus technolodies and techniques into the future. 

Modbus is about hi-tech devices constantaly updating "registers" that can then be polled or even updated by esternal devices. This has least moved from serial communication to TCP over the internet identifying "clients" by ip address instead iof unique ids in a broadcast fashion.

I am in the process of implementing examination and monitoring tools that can be used remotely by WiFi or computers that are physically connected LANs that have Modbus PCL oriented units in range.

I and quickly prototyping and producing useful tools and applications that will be available and reliable in the coming weeks and months.
